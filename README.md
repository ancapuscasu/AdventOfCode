# Advent of Code

üéÅ Here are my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges! üéÅ

## What is Advent of Code?

[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), the creator of the **Advent of Code** challenge describes it as:

> An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.<br>

Each puzzle is worth one ‚≠ê and Eric posts two puzzles per day from December 1-25. To complete the challenge, you must get 50 ‚≠ê (aka solve all of the puzzles) by December 25th.<br>

## What can you find in this repository?

This repository is my attempt at solving the Advent of Code challenges using JavaScript. Maybe one day I will be brave enough to attempt other programming languages after which I will update this text. 

You will find my solutions organized in the following way:

```
-- Year
   -- Day[number]
   -- question.txt
      -- Part[number]
         -- input.txt
         -- solution.js
```
