# Advent of Code

🎁 Here are my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges! 🎁

## What is Advent of Code?

[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), the creator of the Advent of Code challenge describes it as:

> An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.<br>

Each day consists of two puzzles. To complete the challenge, you must solve all of the puzzles by December 25th.<br>
